  <h1>"Why This Started", By Nicholas Mellie</h1>

  <p>
    You all know that patrols get picked fairly by teachers, 
    but is it actually fair? This article will cover why we are starting a petition, 
    what will be the expected outcome, and who will be able to sign.
  </p>

  <p>
    Me and my friend Damien have been noticing recently that the Radcliffe school grounds 
    have been unfair when it comes to who gets picked for patrols. 
    Certain students seem to always be chosen, while others don’t even get a chance. 
    This doesn’t feel right, and it’s why we’re speaking up.
  </p>

  <p>
  Another concern we’ve noticed is with the baseball field. The grass has become 
  overgrown, making it difficult to play safely and properly. On top of that, a tree 
  is pushing against the backboard, which creates a serious risk of it falling down. 
  This not only affects the quality of the field but also puts students in danger 
  during games and practices.
</p>
  
  <p>
    The goal of this petition is to make the process fairer for everyone. 
    We want every student to have an equal opportunity to participate 
    in patrols, no matter who they are. 
    By signing this petition, you are helping us push for change.
  </p>

  <p>
    We want all students, teachers, and even parents to support this cause. 
    Together, we can make the students and the school happy and fair for everyone. 
    Please consider adding your name to the petition and helping us bring these issue to light.
