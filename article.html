  <h1>"Why This Started", By Nicholas Mellie</h1>

  <p>
    You all know that we go up to High Five Hill every day for recess, but is it actually that safe? 
    By the end of this article, you will know if High Five Hill is actually safe.
  </p>

  <p>
   On Monday, Damien and I went up to High Five Hill as usual, when we noticed a lot of overgrown grass on the baseball field. Also, a tree was putting pressure 
    on the metal backboard, which was causing an unsafe environment under the backboard.
  </p>

    <p>
   That is why we've started this petition. This petition aims to encourage Mr. Kearny to allow people to do maintenance
      or even allow US to clean High Five Hill so we can restore it to its former glory.
